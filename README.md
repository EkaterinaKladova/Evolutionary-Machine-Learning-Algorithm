This simple homework implements an evolutionary algorithm for neural networks which try to sort NYC houses into categories of "cheap" and "expensive."  Some numbers (like the number of generations) have been lowered from the original requirements for the sake of speeding up the process.  The original numbers can be found in the comments.

It includes mutation, which happens after 28 (should be 144) children are generated by taking the average of the 4 parents.  Then, the top 4 individuals (children + parents) are selected for the next generation.

The program also outputs a graph of how accurate the top neural net in each generation is, to help track the progress of the algorithm.
